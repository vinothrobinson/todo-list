# todo-list
This is a JavaScript implementation of a Todo-List, which is enhanced by webpack features for better design flow. 

This implementation also uses localStorage to store your tasks and projects. Currently, there is no use for "Priority" feature in the tasks, but this may be changed in the future.

The goal was to set up basic code to create tasks, remove tasks, create projects, and create specific tasks for these projects. Other features such as deadlines for tasks and priority are still a work in progress.
